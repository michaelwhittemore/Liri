# Liri
Homework 10

Liri takes in one of four commands:
concert-this
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says

The arguments after the command will either be an artist, a song, or a movie respectivley.
If the command is 'do-what-it-says' then Liri will read the content of random.txt as if it were a commandline argument
